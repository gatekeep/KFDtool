# KFD-AVR
This is a fork of the KFDtool project that works on an Arduino-compatible processor. Currently, the following platforms are supported:

- ATMega328p (Arduino Uno, most clones)
- ATmega2560 (Arduino Mega, most clones)
- ATMega32u4 (Arduino Leonardo, Pro Micro, and some clones)

In the works are ESP8266/ESP32 and different variants of ARM/Cortex chips.
